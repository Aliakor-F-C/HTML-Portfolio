    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Greetings! I am Aliakor Franklin, a biomedical scientist and an aspiring full-stack web developer who is
        passionate about creativity and technology.
        I began learning web development in August 2025, starting with HTML, with plans to progress into CSS,
        JavaScript, and beyond as I continue to sharpen my skills.
        My long-term goal is to grow into a well-rounded full-stack developer.</p>

    <p>I enjoy being creative and innovative, and for me, technology is the perfect space to express that passion.
        My journey into web development is fueled by a desire to stay connected with the ever-evolving world of
        technology while building solutions that are practical, impactful, and future-ready.
    </p>

    <p>I am particularly enthusiastic about solving problems and tackling complex challenges that most people shy away
        from.
        I find real satisfaction in breaking down tough problems and seeing ideas polished and brought to life as
        working solutions.
        As a biomedical scientist, I have been trained in analytical thinking, problem solving, observation, and
        experimentation, serving as tools I now apply to technological creativity.</p>

    <p>Beyond science and coding, I am also a singer and songwriter with a special interest in Afrobeat music.
        I graduated with First Class Honours and received the award for Best Graduating Student in the Department of
        Clinical Chemistry at Nnamdi Azikiwe University.</p>

    <p>At the heart of everything I do is a drive to learn, create, and make a lasting impact.
        This portfolio will continue to grow as I do.</p>
